## Introduction

> ***Note:*** *Project 1 is a group programming project designed to show users(namely, WDI 51 students) restaurant options near the San Francisco General Assembly Campus. Our group members consist of Nicolette Lewis, Jonathan Jolivette, Bryant Pham, & Darnell Simon.*

For this project, we utilized the information we learned from the last several weeks. We used jQuery's AJAX function to make calls to Google Places API to retrieve coordinates of recommended restuarants. We then used those coordinates to load pins onto a Google map to display it's location.

## Objectives

- Use recommendation form to collect student's restaurant recommendations.
- Use AJAX to grab Google Places API and embed restaurants on map.
-Display restaurant information and its recommendations.

#### Starter code

There was no starter code. We referenced passed lessons to piece together our idea.

#### Deliverable

Our goal is to:
- Connect our frontend with our backend
- Display a Google Map with a pin at the location of each of every recommendation a user posts.

Here's a screenshot of what the final product looks like:

## Deliverable

Our goal is to:
-Connect our frontend with our backend.
-Display location of recommended restaurant on a map.
-Display information about the restaurant. 
-Create a database to save restaurant information.

#### Part 1. Rendering Data
We familiarized ourselves with the dataset from Google Places,[https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/places/].

+ We thought about how we would:
-structure the data
-grab its title
-grab its coordinates


#### Pain Point
-Staying optisimistic, balancing optimism with reality. 
-External API's only as good as the documentation. Are always a risk.


#### Lessons Learned

Nicolette:
-Focus on MVP, check direction of work constantly.
-File structure is key
-Communication is fundamental

Jonathan:
-Delegation
-Communication
-Personal accountabilty is at play when working on a team to produce a product.
-None of these components are mutually exclusive.

Bryant:
-Better understanding of task dependencies.
-API's are always a risk
-File structure must be rock solid to build off of. 


Darnell:
-Simplicity is key, the real MVP.
-Communication is important; to understand what tasks to complete and when to complete it.
-Prioritizing tasks based on level of importance.
